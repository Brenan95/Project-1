# Project-1

--Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project is code that was supposed to make a clock that showed both 12 hr and 24 hr time

--What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did formatting well. 

--Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I feel adding for comments and also making sure the code functions to the specifications of the assignment would be what I'd do differently.

--Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Honestly the whole thing was pretty challengig I can't just choose one portion of it out of the whole thing. 

--What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I believe everything I learned in this project was a skill I can use in the future. 

--How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made sure to label the code the best I could and keep it organized in the way that it needed.
